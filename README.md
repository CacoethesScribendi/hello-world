# hello-world
A programming rite of passage. Hello world!

My name is Carmen! I often utilize usernames with the word "scribendi" in it. 

Scribendi is a latin word meaning "to write". I often pair scribendi with "cacoethes". Cacoethes means an insatiable urge.

Combining the two into Cacoethes Scribendi means "the insatiable urge to write". This name accurately reflects my desire 
to create content to share on the web.

I originally started to learn to code as a potential hobby. I look forward to getting better daily!
